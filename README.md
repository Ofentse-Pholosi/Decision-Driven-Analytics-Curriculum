# Decision-Driven Analytics for MT5 EA

### Bridging Business Analysis and Data Analytics Through a Self-Paced, Decision-First Curriculum

## Overview

This repository documents a **self-paced learning journey** designed to deliberately bridge **Business Analysis (BA)** and **Data Analytics**, using an MT5 automated trading system (Expert Advisor) as the applied domain.

Rather than presenting a polished, “final” solution, this project is intentionally curated as a **transparent, step-by-step build-up of analytical capability**—from decision framing, through KPI design and data modeling, to dashboards and impact measurement.

The emphasis is not on claiming expertise upfront, but on **demonstrating how disciplined analytics thinking is developed in practice**.

## What This Project Is (and Is Not)

### What It Is

* A **self-paced analytics curriculum**, executed in public
* A practical demonstration of **upskilling in Business Analysis and Data Analytics**
* A decision-driven approach to analytics, where each step builds on the previous one
* A portfolio that shows *how* analytical thinking evolves, not just the end result

### What It Is Not

* A “know-it-all” trading system
* A black-box strategy claiming guaranteed profitability
* A dashboard-first or tool-driven analytics project
* A static or closed piece of work

This repository intentionally exposes **assumptions, trade-offs, revisions, and learning progression**.

Scrutiny is not only accepted—it is welcomed.

## Learning-First Design Philosophy

Most analytics portfolios only show outcomes.
This project shows **process**.

The work is structured as a sequence of modules, each producing a concrete artifact and tightening analytical discipline:

1. **Decision Framing** – What decision is actually being made?
2. **Business-Aligned KPIs** – How do we objectively judge success or failure?
3. **Data Modeling** – How must data be structured to support those judgments?
4. **Analysis & Visualization** – Only after the above are clear
5. **Impact Measurement** – Did the decision change outcomes?

By treating the project as a curriculum rather than a showcase, the repository makes learning **auditable and reviewable**.

## Role of AI / LLM Assistance (Transparency Note)

A Large Language Model (LLM) is intentionally used throughout this project as a **guiding and review tool**, similar to how one might leverage:

* A senior mentor
* A code reviewer
* Or a structured study guide

The LLM does **not**:

* Generate conclusions without scrutiny
* Replace reasoning or judgment
* Act as an authority

Instead, it is used to:

* Challenge assumptions
* Enforce analytical rigor
* Provide structured feedback
* Accelerate learning without skipping fundamentals

All decisions, interpretations, and final artifacts remain **human-owned and accountable**.

---

## Why This Project Exists

Many analytics efforts fail because they:

* Start with data instead of a decision
* Produce insights without ownership or action
* Optimise metrics without understanding risk
* Hide learning behind polished visuals

This project deliberately avoids those pitfalls by applying **business analysis discipline before analytics execution**.

The guiding question is:

> *Should a standardized MT5 EA configuration—restricted to Step Index synthetic instruments and governed by strict risk controls—be deployed for sustained capital allocation?*

Every artifact in this repository exists to support, test, or challenge that decision.

## Objectives

### 1. Demonstrate Decision Governance

* Clearly define decision ownership
* Document assumptions, constraints, and risks
* Avoid intuition-driven strategy changes

### 2. Build Business-Aligned Analytics

* Translate trading behaviour into decision-grade KPIs
* Prioritise capital preservation over raw returns
* Use leading and lagging indicators appropriately

### 3. Apply Analytics Engineering Discipline

* Model data explicitly for decision support
* Define correct analytical grain (trade, session, daily)
* Prevent common analytical errors through structure

### 4. Showcase Transparent Upskilling

* Show learning progression, not just outcomes
* Produce reviewable, portfolio-grade artifacts
* Make reasoning and trade-offs visible

## Project Structure & Progress

### ✅ Module 1 — Analytics With Intent

Decision framing and strategic context definition.

### ✅ Module 2 — Business Analysis Essentials for Analysts

Formal KPI and metric design aligned to decision criteria.

### 🔄 Module 3 — Data Modeling for Decision Support (In Progress)

Designing analytics-ready data structures to support KPIs.

### ⏳ Upcoming Modules

* Hypothesis-driven exploratory analysis
* Decision-focused dashboards
* Impact measurement (before vs after standardisation)
* Portfolio packaging and stakeholder communication

---

## Relationship to the Dashboard

An earlier phase of this work focused on building an MT5 EA analytics dashboard.

This repository reframes that dashboard as:

> **An output of disciplined decision analytics, not the starting point.**

Visualization is treated as a communication layer, not a substitute for reasoning.

---

## Guiding Principles

* Decisions before data
* Risk before reward
* Structure before visualization
* Learning before optimisation
* Transparency over polish

---

## Intended Audience

* Business Analysts developing analytical depth
* Data Analysts strengthening business decision impact
* Engineers interested in analytics architecture
* Anyone exploring decision-driven analytics in practice

---

## Status

**Active, evolving, and intentionally transparent**

This repository reflects a learning journey in progress.
Expect iteration, revision, and refinement.

---

## Contribution & Critique Guidelines

This repository is intentionally **open to review, critique, and discussion**.

Because the project is designed as a **self-paced learning curriculum**, external feedback is viewed as a core part of the learning process rather than an afterthought.

### What Kind of Feedback Is Welcome

Contributions and critiques are especially encouraged in the following areas:

* **Decision framing**

  * Are the business decisions clearly defined?
  * Are assumptions and constraints reasonable and explicit?

* **KPI design**

  * Do the metrics genuinely support the stated decision?
  * Are thresholds defensible and risk-aware?

* **Data modeling**

  * Is the chosen grain appropriate?
  * Are there risks of aggregation bias or metric distortion?

* **Analytical reasoning**

  * Are conclusions logically supported by the evidence?
  * Are alternative interpretations sufficiently considered?

* **Structure and clarity**

  * Is the progression from decision → data → insight understandable?
  * Can non-technical stakeholders follow the reasoning?

### How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute:

1. **Open an Issue**

   * Use issues for questions, critiques, or alternative perspectives
   * Be specific about the section or artifact you are commenting on

2. **Submit a Pull Request**

   * Suggested improvements to documentation, models, or explanations are welcome
   * Clearly explain the reasoning behind your proposed changes

3. **Propose Alternatives, Not Just Corrections**

   * If you disagree with an approach, suggest a viable alternative
   * Trade-offs and reasoning matter more than “right answers”

---

### What This Project Asks in Return

To keep feedback productive and aligned with the project’s goals:

* Critique **ideas and reasoning**, not individuals
* Avoid claims of guaranteed trading performance or financial advice
* Ground feedback in logic, evidence, or experience
* Respect that this is a **learning-in-public** initiative

Disagreement is expected. Unexamined assertions are not.

---

### About Ownership and Accountability

While feedback is encouraged, all final decisions remain the responsibility of the project author.
This repository is not crowdsourced strategy development—it is a **guided learning exercise** with a single accountable decision owner.

Feedback informs learning; it does not override judgment.
