# Decision-Driven Analytics for MT5 EA

### Bridging Business Analysis and Data Analytics for Decision-Grade Trading Intelligence

## Overview

This project demonstrates how **Business Analysis** and **Data Analytics** can be intentionally combined to produce **decision-driven analytics**, using an MT5 automated trading system (Expert Advisor) as the applied domain.

Rather than starting with charts or dashboards, the project begins with:

* Clear decision framing
* Business-aligned KPIs
* Proper analytical data modeling

The end goal is a **decision-grade analytics dashboard**, but the dashboard is treated as the *final output* of disciplined analysis—not the starting point.

This approach reflects how analytics should operate in real-world environments such as fintech, product analytics, and operational decision support.

## Why This Project

Many analytics initiatives struggle because they:

* Start with available data instead of a decision
* Produce insights without clear actions
* Build dashboards that look good but do not influence outcomes

This project was designed to address those gaps by applying **business analysis principles upfront**, ensuring that analytics directly supports an accountable decision.

The central question guiding this work is:

> *Should a standardized MT5 EA configuration—restricted to Step Index synthetic instruments and governed by strict risk rules—be deployed for sustained capital allocation?*

All data analysis, modeling, and visualization exists solely to support that decision.

## Objectives

### 1. Decision Governance

* Define a clear, accountable business decision
* Explicitly document assumptions, constraints, and risks
* Avoid strategy changes driven by short-term performance noise

### 2. Business-Aligned Metrics

* Translate trading behaviour into decision-grade KPIs
* Prioritise capital preservation before profit maximisation
* Separate leading indicators (early warnings) from lagging indicators (outcomes)

### 3. Analytics Engineering Discipline

* Convert raw MT5 trade history into analytics-ready data structures
* Define correct data grain (trade, session, daily)
* Ensure metrics are auditable, reproducible, and explainable

### 4. Portfolio-Ready Analytics

* Demonstrate practical Business Analysis and Data Analytics capability
* Produce artifacts suitable for professional review
* Position the work as transferable beyond trading use cases

## Project Structure & Progress

This repository follows a **structured, self-paced curriculum** that incrementally builds from business framing to analytics execution.

### ✅ Module 1 — Analytics With Intent

**Focus:** Decision framing
**Outcome:** A formal Decision Framing Document defining:

* Business context
* Decision ownership
* Strategic options
* Decision criteria
* Assumptions, constraints, and risks

---

### ✅ Module 2 — Business Analysis Essentials for Analysts

**Focus:** KPI and metrics definition
**Outcome:** A KPI & Metrics Definition Pack including:

* Risk control metrics (single-trade exposure, drawdown)
* Performance metrics (profit consistency, recovery factor)
* Behavioural diagnostics (scalping integrity)

---

### 🔄 Module 3 — Data Modeling for Decision Support (In Progress)

**Focus:** Analytics-ready data structures
**Planned Outcome:**

* Fact and dimension tables aligned to decision grain
* Trade-, session-, and daily-level performance separation
* Explicit KPI-to-data traceability

---

### ⏳ Upcoming Work

* Hypothesis-driven exploratory analysis
* Decision-focused dashboards
* Impact measurement (before vs after standardisation)
* Stakeholder-ready reporting and portfolio packaging

## Relationship to the Dashboard

An earlier phase of this work focused primarily on building an MT5 EA analytics dashboard.

This repository **re-grounds that dashboard** in:

* Business objectives
* Risk governance
* Decision accountability

In short:

> **The dashboard becomes the expression of a disciplined analytical system, not the system itself.**

---

## Guiding Principles

* Decisions before data
* Risk before reward
* Structure before visualization
* Explanation before optimisation

---

## Intended Audience

* Business Analysts expanding into data analytics
* Data Analysts seeking stronger business impact
* Engineers building analytics systems with decision accountability
* Fintech and algorithmic trading practitioners

---

## Status

**Active development**
Foundational analytics layers are being finalised prior to dashboard expansion.

Just tell me the intended primary audience for the repo.
